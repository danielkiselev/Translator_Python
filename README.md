# Translator_Python
Translates a C program into assembly styled code. 
Essentially taking a normal C program and translating it into a smaller subset of C. 
The same project was done in both OCaml and in Python providing identical functionality.

To UofR Faculty/TA accusing me of breaking the academic honesty code section below:

Aiding another person in an act that violates the standards of academic honesty. Examples include allowing other students to look at one’s own work during an exam or in an assignment where collaboration is not allowed; unauthorized editing or revising of another student’s work; providing information, material, or assistance to another person in a form that is likely to be used in violation of course, departmental, or college academic honesty policies; failing to take reasonable measures to protect one’s work from copying by others.

My code is covered by GitHub’s Terms of Service, so nobody else can legally use any part of my GitHub project in their code.
Furthermore, it's covered by "17 U.S. Code § 106 - Exclusive rights in copyrighted works". 

This is taking reasonable measures to protect my work from being copied by others. If any professor takes issue with this choice, then rather than reusing the same projects every semester make new assignments. :)
